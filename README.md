# Medical Stock Management System – Frontend
# Project Summary

The Medical Stock Management System (Frontend) is a web-based user interface developed to manage medicine inventory efficiently. This frontend application allows users to interact with the system to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on medical stock data in a simple and user-friendly way.

The application provides forms to add new medicines, displays available stock in a structured table, allows updating medicine details such as quantity and price, and supports deleting expired or unnecessary records. It communicates with the backend REST APIs to fetch and update data in real time.

This frontend is designed to reduce manual work, improve accuracy, and make medicine stock handling easier for hospitals and medical stores.
